/*Instructions from your teacher:
Given an int variable n that has already been declared and initialized to a positive value, and another int variable j that has already been declared, use a for loop to print a single line consisting of n asterisks. Thus if n contains 5, five asterisks will be printed. Use no variables other than n and j.



Example:
input: 1
output: *

Example:
input: 3
output: ***


NO NEED FOR ARRAY HERE, JUST USE LOOP*/
